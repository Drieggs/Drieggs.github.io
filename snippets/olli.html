      <h2> Olli - Social Media Photo Sharing Mobile Application </h2> 
      <h3> Objective </h3>
      <p>Design and develop the front-end of a photo sharing social media application. My responsibilities included designing the UX/UI and coding the HTML and CSS of the app. </p>
      <h3> Challenge</h3>
      <p>Using only the general idea for the premise of Olli I was tasked to design the UX and UI of the app. Entering into the social media space is extrememly difficult and packed with competitors. Users trying out these apps are extremely picky and poor UX or unattractive UI can cause users to immediately abandon the app.</p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
      <p>I began by studying the competition. I was interested in finding out two main things; what basic design standards were present throughout most of them, and what the users complained about. In order to compensate for users low tolerance for error I needed to make the app as user friendly as possible. The barrier to entry had to be almost non-existant and everything had to be extremely intuitive. Taking what I learned from studying the competition I was able to model basic pages of the app (settings, friends list, login, etc) to conventional guidelines to reduce friction of use. I also made it a priority that the login/sign-up page took as little time as possible; designing a system where signing up only required one-click.</p>
      <p>I then started conducting interviews with potential users on what features they enjoyed or hated while using the competitors' apps. With all this information in mind I created some low-fidelity mock-ups and then a high-fidelity prototype that could be used to test and monitor users. Knowing that mishandled design could quickly lead to loss of users, I developed a Minimum Viable Product that could be tested extensively before the actual development of the app was even half-way done. Interviewing users with my working prototype allowed us to avoid a lot of development. We were able to avoid heavily focusing on developing parts of the app that we thought were important, but the users completely disregarded. In tandum with testing I helped code the CSS and HTML of the app. In this way we were able to build an app with the focus centered around the users' needs. </p>
