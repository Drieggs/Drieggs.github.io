          <h2> Keyman Project </h2> 
          <h3> Objective </h3>
          <p>Do a complete overhaul of the website's front-end. Assess issues with the old UX design, and develop a UI that gives the website a more updated look and feel.  </p>
          <h3> Challenge</h3>
          <p>The website is unfamiliar, complex and outdated (i.e. no one has updated the site’s UI or navigation since its creation in 2005); additionally, the original developer is no longer under their employment. According to the client, a lot of the most important information was not easily accessible. There were also a lot of dead-ends and irrelevant or outdated information throughout the site. </p>
          <h3> Solution </h3>
          <p>While reviewing each page, I simultaneously created a site map. This allowed me streamline my review process, gain an in-depth understanding of the product and create the documentation I would later need to pinpoint usability issues to those unfamiliar with the site’s complexity. I then interviewed the client on what his goals were for the website to gain an understanding of what they valued as important in the site. </p>
          <p>Using the site-map as a guide alongside the information gained from interviewing the client, I was able to mock-up a new design which emphasized the most important information and gave the website a more clean and updated feel. The mock-up allowed the client to get a clear understanding of the new design before starting development. After approving the mock-up with the client I coded the HTML, CSS, and some of the JS of the design with the collaboration of a back-end developer to finish the project.  </p>
